# Kernforge Detailed Usage Guide

This document explains how to use the currently implemented Kernforge features in real engineering workflows, with concrete examples and recommended command sequences.

Reference point:
- Codebase snapshot: 2026-04-29

Intended readers:
- Windows security engineers
- Anti-cheat engineers
- Kernel and user-mode telemetry engineers
- Driver, signing, symbol, and package readiness engineers
- Unreal Engine security and integrity engineers

Goals of this guide:
1. Explain real usage patterns instead of just listing features.
2. Show which command combinations fit which kinds of problems.
3. Teach the full loop of `analyze-project -> analyze-performance -> investigate -> simulate -> fuzz-func -> review/edit/plan -> verify -> evidence/memory/hooks`.

## 1. The Best Way To Think About Kernforge

Kernforge can be used like a normal coding CLI, but its strongest current value now comes from building a reusable project knowledge pack before running sensitive engineering changes through the rest of the loop.

The best current loop looks like this:

1. If the workspace is large or unfamiliar, run `/analyze-project` first.
2. Use `/analyze-performance` to turn the latest knowledge pack into a bottleneck lens when performance or startup paths matter.
3. If live state matters, use `/investigate` to capture the current system state.
4. If an extra risk lens matters, use `/simulate` to evaluate tamper, visibility, or forensic blind spots.
5. If attacker-controlled parameter behavior matters, run `/fuzz-func` for source-level fuzz reasoning; when a seed handoff is useful, Kernforge prints `/fuzz-campaign run` as the next step.
6. Use `/review-selection`, `/edit-selection`, `/do-plan-review`, or `/new-feature` to drive the work.
7. Run `/verify` to execute the verification plan.
8. Use `/evidence-*` and `/mem-*` to inspect both recent signals and longer-lived context.
9. Follow the printed handoff blocks after analysis, investigation, simulation, performance, fuzzing, verification, evidence, memory, checkpoint, feature, worktree, and specialist actions instead of memorizing the command order.
10. Let hooks act as the final policy layer before push or PR.

Practical interpretation:
1. `analyze-project` builds a reusable architecture map instead of a disposable summary.
2. `analyze-performance` extracts likely hot paths and bottlenecks from the latest architecture knowledge.
3. `investigate` captures what is happening live.
4. `simulate` highlights risk-oriented weak spots using lightweight heuristics.
5. `fuzz-func` synthesizes attacker input states, counterexamples, and branch deltas from real source-level guard/probe/copy/dispatch behavior.
6. `verify` turns code changes and recent context into a concrete validation plan.
7. `evidence` stores structured recent signals.
8. `memory` keeps conclusions across sessions.
9. `hooks` turn that accumulated context back into guardrails.

## 2. Core Features And When To Use Them

### Input And Cancellation Handling

Purpose:
1. Keep prompt cancel and in-flight request cancel distinct on Windows consoles.
2. Avoid missing brief `Esc` taps during a running request.
3. Prevent leftover console `Esc` input from auto-canceling the next prompt after request cancel.

Current behavior:
1. `Esc` while typing cancels only the current prompt input.
2. `Esc` during model response wait cancels the in-flight request.
3. On Windows, Kernforge combines async key-state checks with console input polling so short `Esc` taps are still recognized.
4. After request cancel, Kernforge waits briefly for `Esc` release and clears pending console input before opening the next prompt.
5. Assistant streaming now suppresses empty leading chunks, flushes cleanly before progress lines, and breaks repeated follow-on preambles onto separate lines for readability.
6. Generic waiting text is collapsed so the thinking indicator does not repeat the same status twice.
7. Repeated blank streamed chunks are converted into a compact working status instead of printing empty lines.
8. If a final streamed answer appears to stop mid-sentence, Kernforge asks the model to continue once and merges the continuation before returning to the prompt.
9. Pressing `Enter` on an empty main prompt is ignored so empty turns do not clutter the session transcript.
10. The REPL opens with a compact branded banner and keeps assistant output separate from tool and verification activity lines.

### Runtime Inspection And Approval State

Purpose:
1. Distinguish between current session state and merged effective settings.
2. Make write, diff, shell, and git approvals visible without opening config files.
3. Keep git-mutating actions on a separate approval path from normal file edits.

Useful commands:
- `/status`
- `/config`
- `/provider status`

Current behavior:
1. `/status` shows session and runtime state such as the active session id, current approvals, selection state, verification state, and MCP counts.
2. `/config` shows effective settings such as provider defaults, token limits, locale behavior, hook settings, and verification defaults.
3. `/provider status` shows the active provider, normalized endpoint, API key presence, and provider-specific budget visibility.
4. For OpenRouter, `/provider status` performs a live lookup of key-level `limit_remaining` and `usage`, and it also shows account credits when the key is a management key.
5. For OpenAI and Anthropic, `/provider status` intentionally shows officially documented billing and usage visibility limits instead of inventing a live balance endpoint.
6. `Allow write?` and `Open diff preview?` can be auto-approved for the current session with `a`.
7. Git-mutating tools such as `git_add`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, and `git_create_pr` use a separate `Allow git?` session approval.
8. Git-mutating tools are intended for explicit user requests rather than normal review or edit turns.

### Prompt Intent Routing

Purpose:
1. Keep analysis and explanation requests read-only by default.
2. Keep explicit fix requests tool-driven instead of drifting into prose-only advice.
3. Reduce accidental patch handoff or accidental git mutation during normal code review.

Current behavior:
1. Requests that ask to analyze, explain, diagnose, review, or document default to read-only investigation mode unless they also explicitly ask for a fix.
2. Requests that explicitly ask to fix code keep edit tools available and Kernforge nudges the model back toward direct tool use if it tries to hand the patch back to the user.
3. Git staging, commit, push, and PR creation are blocked unless the user explicitly asked for that git action.

### Read Reuse And Large-File Inspection

Purpose:
1. Reduce repeated `read_file` churn on very large source files.
2. Make `grep` results expose when nearby context was already read.
3. Nudge the model away from scanning the same region again when cache evidence already exists.

Current behavior:
1. `read_file` reuses unchanged exact ranges, covered subranges, and partial overlaps before it falls back to fresh file reads.
2. Cached `read_file` replies include a `NOTE:` prefix so the model can treat them as already-seen context rather than fresh evidence.
3. Repeated same-file `read_file` turns now use that cache signal to warn earlier when the model is looping on the same chunk.
4. `grep` annotates matches with `[cached-nearby:inside]` when the matching line already sits inside a recent read span.
5. `grep` annotates matches with `[cached-nearby:N]` when the match is near a recently read span, which encourages a narrower follow-up `read_file` request.
6. Stale read hints are ignored automatically when file size or modification time changes.

Practical interpretation:
1. If you see `NOTE: returning cached content...`, the tool is telling the model it already has that text and should only read a missing adjacent range if necessary.
2. If `grep` returns `[cached-nearby:inside]`, the next best action is usually edit, explain, or read a tiny adjacent gap rather than rescanning a large block.
3. If `grep` returns `[cached-nearby:2]`, `[cached-nearby:5]`, and similar markers, the model should usually read only that small uncovered neighborhood.

### 2.0 Project Analysis

Purpose:
1. Build a reusable architecture document for a large workspace.
2. Split analysis across multiple worker and reviewer passes.
3. Keep a `latest` knowledge pack and performance lens for follow-up work.
4. Reuse unchanged shard results when incremental mode is enabled.
5. Preserve a structural index, Unreal semantic graph, and vector corpus for downstream automation.
6. Preserve deterministic architecture facts so cached deep-structure answers can be checked against source-derived invariants.
7. End the run with a highlighted `Analysis artifacts:` block and an `Analysis handoff` so the user can continue into the dashboard, fuzz campaign automation, target drilldown, or verification without memorizing the sequence.

Useful commands:
- `/analyze-project [--mode map|trace|impact|surface|security|performance] [goal]`
- `/docs-refresh`
- `/analyze-performance [focus]`
- `/set-analysis-models`

The goal is optional. If omitted, Kernforge infers a practical goal from the selected mode and path.
Follow-up modes automatically load a previous `map` run as baseline structure when available. This lets `trace`, `impact`, `surface`, `security`, and `performance` start from the architecture map without sharing the same shard cache.
Before confirmation, the analysis plan prints the selected `baseline_map` so the user can see which map run will be reused.
Large runs are provider-failure tolerant: worker/reviewer rate limits are recorded as low-confidence shard failures, and synthesis falls back to a local document when the final model request fails.

Role split:
1. `README.md` is the quick product-scope, flagship-command, and artifact-location document.
2. This feature guide explains the operating sequence across investigation, simulation, fuzzing, verification, evidence, and memory.
3. Generated `analyze-project` docs are the per-run project knowledge base with source anchors, confidence, and stale/invalidation markers.

Mode summary:
1. `map` is the default mode and prioritizes architecture ownership and module boundaries.
2. `trace` emphasizes runtime flow, caller/callee chains, and dispatch order.
3. `impact` emphasizes change impact, downstream dependencies, and retest scope.
4. `security` emphasizes trust boundaries, validation, and privileged surfaces.
5. `performance` emphasizes startup cost, hot paths, contention, and blocking chains.

Best used when:
1. You are entering a large codebase and need more than an ad hoc summary.
2. The work spans startup, integrity, ETW, scanner, compression, memory, or upload paths.
3. You want follow-up review and verification to inherit a stable architecture view.
4. You are dealing with a UE5-scale codebase where modules, targets, reflection, replication, and asset/config coupling all matter at once.

Additional artifacts now produced by project analysis:
1. `snapshot`: structured scan output plus runtime and project edges.
2. `structural index`: symbol anchors, references, build contexts, build ownership edges, call edges, and overlay-oriented analysis state.
3. `unreal graph`: UE project, module, network, asset, system, and config semantics.
4. `architecture facts`: deterministic domain hints, top-level directory facts, critical anchors, dispatch/registration flows, boundary facts, and answer invariants.
5. `knowledge pack`: human-readable architecture digest and subsystem summaries.
6. `vector corpus`: embedding-ready project, subsystem, and shard documents.
7. `vector ingest exports`: staging files for pgvector, SQLite, and Qdrant pipelines.

What materially changed for large and Unreal-heavy workspaces:
1. A semantic shard planner now prioritizes `startup`, `build_graph`, `unreal_network`, `unreal_ui`, `unreal_ability`, `asset_config`, `integrity_security`, and `unreal_gameplay`.
2. Worker and reviewer prompts now carry shard-specific semantic focus and review checklists.
3. Incremental reuse now considers semantic fingerprints instead of relying only on file hashes.
4. Build alignment now promotes `.uproject`, `.uplugin`, `.Build.cs`, `.Target.cs`, and `compile_commands.json` into reusable build-context records.
5. Source anchors now lift Go, C++, and C# functions into symbol records with line ranges, call edges, build ownership edges, and security overlays.
6. `trace`, `impact`, and `security` retrieval now expand graph neighborhoods instead of relying only on keyword hits, and they persist `build_context_v2` plus `path_v2` evidence.
7. The C++ anchor parser now covers template out-of-line methods, operators, `requires`, `decltype(auto)`, API-macro-wrapped scopes, and friend functions.
8. Output documents now expose subsystem invalidation reasons, evidence, diffs, top change classes, and graph-section stale markers.
9. The dashboard stale diff links graph-related changes directly into trust-boundary, data-flow, and project-edge sections.
10. Persisted artifacts now include machine-readable snapshot, structural index, Unreal semantic graph, vector corpus, and ingestion seed files for downstream retrieval pipelines.
11. The architecture fact pack is injected into worker/reviewer/synthesis prompts and into cached answer packs so structure answers stay source-grounded even when no extra tool call is needed.
12. C/C++ and driver-oriented scanners now look for dispatch tables, unload/finalize paths, callback registrations, filter registrations, aliases, macros, and include-driven registration helpers instead of relying only on filename heuristics.
13. `.kernforge/analysis/latest` is replaced per run, avoiding stale artifact bleed-through across repeated analysis tests.
14. Goal text can narrow analysis to matching directories when you clearly target a sub-area.
15. Interactive runs can flag hidden or external-looking directories so you can exclude them before scanning.

### Source-Level Function Fuzzing

Purpose:
1. Show how attacker-controlled parameters could open guard, probe, copy, dispatch, and cleanup paths directly from source.
2. Go beyond generic review comments by telling you which predicate to flip with which value and which sink opens afterward.
3. Let you start from either one function or one suspicious file and still converge on the most relevant input-facing path.

Useful commands:
- `/fuzz-func <function-name>`
- `/fuzz-func <function-name> --file <path>`
- `/fuzz-func <function-name> @<path>`
- `/fuzz-func --file <path>`
- `/fuzz-func @<path>`
- `/fuzz-func status`
- `/fuzz-func show [id|latest]`
- `/fuzz-func list`
- `/fuzz-func continue [id|latest]`
- `/fuzz-func language [system|english]`
- `/fuzz-campaign`
- `/fuzz-campaign run`

Best used when:
1. You need fast triage on IOCTL handlers, parsers, validators, or buffer-processing code.
2. You know the suspicious file but not yet the best root function.
3. You want source-only reasoning about size drift, branch flips, check/use desync, or dispatch divergence before building a runtime harness.

Current behavior:
1. If you provide a function name, Kernforge resolves the symbol directly. If you provide only a file path, Kernforge expands through include/import plus actual call flow to pick a representative root automatically.
2. Planning no longer requires `analyze-project` or a prebuilt `structural_index_v2`; Kernforge can rebuild snapshot and semantic-index context on demand.
3. Kernforge extracts real guard, probe, copy, dispatch, and cleanup observations from function bodies and uses them to synthesize attacker input states.
4. Higher-risk findings now include concrete sample values, source-derived branch predicates, minimal counterexamples, branch outcomes, and downstream call chains.
5. Output is organized as `Conclusion`, `Risk score table`, `Top predicted problems`, and `Source-derived attack surface` so the most actionable finding is visible first.
6. Native execution is an optional follow-up. If build context such as `compile_commands.json` is missing, Kernforge explains the gap before asking whether to continue.
7. Artifacts are written under `.kernforge/fuzz/<run-id>/` with files such as `report.md`, `harness.cpp`, and `plan.json`.
8. `/fuzz-func` automatically prints a campaign handoff when source-only scenarios are ready, so the user can continue with `/fuzz-campaign run` instead of learning campaign internals.
9. `/fuzz-campaign` shows the next recommended campaign step and `/fuzz-campaign run` performs the safe automatic action, such as creating a campaign, attaching the latest useful run, promoting source-only scenarios into `corpus/<run-id>/`, updating deduplicated finding lifecycle and coverage gap entries, ingesting libFuzzer logs, llvm-cov text, LCOV, and JSON coverage summaries, capturing sanitizer reports, Windows crash dumps, Application Verifier, and Driver Verifier artifacts, and recording native run results into reports and evidence.
10. Campaign manifests now include a finding list, dedup keys, duplicate counts, merged native/evidence links, parsed coverage reports, run artifacts, coverage gaps, and artifact graph that link targets, seeds, native results, coverage reports, sanitizer/verifier artifacts, evidence ids, source anchors, verification gates, and tracked-feature gates.
11. Native crash findings merge by crash fingerprint, source anchor, and suspected invariant so repeated runs strengthen one tracked issue.
12. Coverage gaps feed the next generated `FUZZ_TARGETS.md` refresh so unexercised seed targets receive explicit ranking feedback.
13. `/fuzz-func ` completion shows function and file usage hints first, then switches to real file candidates after `@`.

Practical interpretation:
1. `Most useful branch delta` is usually the first line worth reading.
2. `Concrete hypothetical input examples` are internal analysis inputs synthesized by Kernforge, not instructions for manual reproduction.
3. `Source-derived attack surface` is the highest-confidence section because it comes from real function-body evidence.
4. Even high-score findings should still be checked against the cited source excerpt, especially when helper or exploit-side files appear in the closure.

### 2.1 Hook Engine

Purpose:
1. Warn, confirm, or block risky actions.
2. Inject extra review context and verification steps before verification runs.
3. Strengthen push and PR policy using recent evidence.
4. Create automatic checkpoints before risky flows.

Useful commands:
- `/hooks`
- `/hook-reload`
- `/init hooks`
- `/override`
- `/override-add <rule-id> <hours> <reason>`
- `/override-clear <override-id|rule-id|all>`

Current actions:
- `warn`
- `ask`
- `deny`
- `append_context`
- `append_review_context`
- `add_verification_step`
- `create_checkpoint`

Best used when:
1. Your team repeatedly hits signing, symbol, provider, XML, or scanner regressions.
2. Passing normal tests is not enough for approval.
3. You want repeatable PR and push guardrails instead of relying on memory.

Recommended operating model:
1. Start with the `windows-security` preset.
2. Add workspace-specific rules in `.kernforge/hooks.json`.
3. Begin with `warn` and `ask`.
4. Promote only repeat incident classes to `deny`.
5. Use `/override-add` only with an expiration and a reason.

### 2.2 Security-Aware Verification

Purpose:
1. Infer security-relevant categories from the changed files.
2. Build verification steps that match the change type.
3. Pull recent simulation and investigation context into verification planning.

Current categories and signals:
1. `driver`
2. `telemetry`
3. `unreal`
4. `memory-scan`
5. Recent high-risk simulation findings
6. Active investigations and live findings

Useful commands:
- `/verify`
- `/verify --full`
- `/verify src/foo.cpp,driver/guard.cpp`
- `/verify-dashboard`
- `/verify-dashboard-html`
- `/set-auto-verify [on|off]`
- `/detect-verification-tools`
- `/set-msbuild-path <path>`
- `/set-cmake-path <path>`
- `/set-ctest-path <path>`
- `/set-ninja-path <path>`

Best used when:
1. Generic `go test`, `msbuild`, or `ctest` is not enough.
2. You need signing, symbols, package, provider, XML, or verifier-oriented follow-up.
3. You already saw risky investigation or simulation findings and want them reflected in validation.

Operational notes:
1. `auto_verify` is now the master switch for edit-triggered verification.
2. When a Windows verification tool such as `msbuild`, `cmake`, `ctest`, or `ninja` is missing, Kernforge first tries to auto-detect and save a usable path for the workspace, then falls back to prompting if detection still fails.
3. Use quotes for paths that contain spaces, for example `/set-msbuild-path "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe"`.
4. Model request timeout is configurable through `request_timeout_seconds`, while `max_request_retries` and `request_retry_delay_ms` control retries for timed-out or transient provider failures.
5. For long-running local validation, prefer `run_shell_background` plus `check_shell_job` so the agent can reuse one expensive build or test job across multiple turns.
6. When a setup, formatter, or generator command is genuinely safer than a manual patch, the agent can use `run_shell` with scoped workspace writes by declaring `allow_workspace_writes=true` and a narrow `write_paths` list.

### 2.3 Evidence Store

Purpose:
1. Store verification, override, investigation, and simulation output as structured evidence.
2. Give you a fast way to inspect recent failed or high-risk signals.
3. Feed recent state back into hooks and verification planning.

Useful commands:
- `/evidence`
- `/evidence-search <query>`
- `/evidence-show <id>`
- `/evidence-dashboard [query]`
- `/evidence-dashboard-html [query]`

Common evidence kinds:
1. `verification_category`
2. `verification_artifact`
3. `verification_failure`
4. `hook_override`
5. `investigation_session`
6. `investigation_snapshot`
7. `investigation_finding`
8. `simulation_run`
9. `simulation_finding`

### 2.4 Persistent Memory

Purpose:
1. Keep important context across sessions.
2. Let you find earlier decisions, failures, and verification context later.
3. Support long-running investigations and repeated regression classes.

Useful commands:
- `/mem`
- `/mem-search <query>`
- `/mem-show <id>`
- `/mem-dashboard [query]`
- `/mem-dashboard-html [query]`

Strength:
1. It stores more than text. It also stores verification categories, tags, artifacts, failures, severities, signals, and risk.

### 2.5 Live Investigation Mode

Purpose:
1. Capture live Windows state as investigation snapshots.
2. Store live findings as evidence and memory.
3. Feed those live findings into simulation and verification later.

Useful commands:
- `/investigate`
- `/investigate start <preset> [target]`
- `/investigate snapshot [target]`
- `/investigate note <text>`
- `/investigate stop [summary]`
- `/investigate list`
- `/investigate show <id>`
- `/investigate dashboard`
- `/investigate dashboard-html`

Current presets:
1. `driver-visibility`
2. `process-visibility`
3. `provider-visibility`

Best used when:
1. Static code review is not enough.
2. You need to capture live verifier, module, driver, service, or provider state before editing.
3. You want a reusable record of the real runtime state that informed later decisions.
4. You want a lightweight visibility triage snapshot before deeper debugging.

Important scope limit:
1. `driver-visibility` is not a deep root-cause analyzer for driver load failures.
2. Its current implementation is intentionally narrow and focuses on user-mode-visible driver, service, filter, verifier, and artifact state.
3. `process-visibility` is a process-listing triage snapshot, not a process attach or protection analyzer.
4. `provider-visibility` is a provider-listing triage snapshot, not a deep ETW or provider root-cause analyzer.

### 2.6 Adversarial Simulation Profiles

Purpose:
1. Evaluate recent evidence and investigation state through a lightweight risk lens.
2. Surface tamper, visibility, and forensic blind spots.
3. Feed that heuristic context back into review, edit, plan-review, and verification flows.

Useful commands:
- `/simulate`
- `/simulate tamper-surface [target]`
- `/simulate stealth-surface [target]`
- `/simulate forensic-blind-spot [target]`
- `/simulate list`
- `/simulate show <id>`
- `/simulate dashboard`
- `/simulate dashboard-html`

Current profiles:
1. `tamper-surface`
2. `stealth-surface`
3. `forensic-blind-spot`

Best used when:
1. You care about integrity or registration risk.
2. You suspect observer or telemetry visibility gaps.
3. You worry that post-incident artifacts may be too weak.

Important scope limit:
1. Simulation is a heuristic risk review, not proof of exploitability.
2. The profile names describe interpretation lenses, not offensive capability.

### 2.7 Selection-First Review And Edit

Purpose:
1. Review or edit only the selected code range instead of the whole file.
2. Automatically inject recent simulation findings when they match the selected area.
3. Inspect workspace and selection diffs in a richer Windows diff surface before wider review or editing.

Useful commands:
- `/open <path>`
- `/selection`
- `/selections`
- `/diff`
- `/diff-selection`
- `/review-selection [extra]`
- `/review-selections [extra]`
- `/edit-selection <task>`
- `/note-selection <text>`
- `/tag-selection <tag[,tag2]>`

Diff workflow notes:
1. On Windows, `/diff` and `/diff-selection` prefer the internal WebView2 diff viewer.
2. The read-only diff viewer includes changed-file navigation, unified/split toggles, and intraline highlights.
3. If the internal surface is unavailable, Kernforge falls back to terminal output.
4. In `Open diff preview?`, answering `a` auto-accepts the current edit and skips future diff previews for the rest of the session.

Best used when:
1. You want to focus on a single IOCTL handler, integrity check, or provider registration block.
2. You want to connect a recent simulation finding directly to the relevant code.

### 2.8 Plan Review Workflow

Purpose:
1. Have one model produce a plan.
2. Have another model review that plan.
3. Execute the approved plan through the normal agent flow.

Useful commands:
- `/set-plan-review`
- `/do-plan-review <task>`

Best used when:
1. A change spans multiple components.
2. Order of operations, rollback points, or operational caution matter.
3. You want simulation findings to shape the implementation plan before edits begin.

Current integration:
1. Recent simulation findings that match the task are injected into the planning prompt.
2. The same perspective is injected again into the final execution prompt.

### 2.9 Tracked Feature Workflow

Purpose:
1. Create a long-lived feature workspace instead of a disposable plan.
2. Persist spec, plan, task, and implementation artifacts under `.kernforge/features/<id>`.
3. Separate planning from execution so large changes can be resumed safely.

Useful commands:
- `/new-feature <task>`
- `/new-feature list`
- `/new-feature status [id]`
- `/new-feature plan [id]`
- `/new-feature implement [id]`
- `/new-feature close [id]`

Best used when:
1. A feature will span multiple sessions or handoffs.
2. You want explicit artifacts for scope, sequencing, and acceptance tracking.
3. You want implementation to be an explicit follow-up step instead of happening immediately after planning.

Current integration:
1. `/new-feature <task>` behaves like `/new-feature start <task>` and creates `feature.json`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`.
2. The created feature becomes the active feature in the session status.
3. `/new-feature implement [id]` executes the saved tracked plan and writes `implementation.md`.

### 2.10 Interactive Ergonomics

Purpose:
1. Reduce typing friction in long investigative and verification-heavy sessions.
2. Make command discovery faster when subcommands or ids are easy to forget.

What `Tab` completion now covers:
1. Slash commands
2. Workspace paths and `@file` mentions
3. MCP resource and prompt targets
4. Fixed command arguments such as `/set-auto-verify on|off`, `/permissions`, `/checkpoint-auto`, `/provider status|anthropic|openai|openrouter|opencode|opencode-go|ollama|codex-cli`, `/profile list|pin|unpin|rename|delete`, `/profile-review list|pin|unpin|rename|delete`, `/verify --full`, `/investigate start <preset>`, `/simulate <profile>`, and `/analyze-project --mode <mode>`
5. Saved ids for `/resume`, `/evidence-show`, `/mem-show`, `/mem-promote`, `/mem-demote`, `/mem-confirm`, `/mem-tentative`, `/investigate show`, `/simulate show`, and `/new-feature status|plan|implement|close`
6. Inline descriptions for command and subcommand suggestions so the completion list explains what each candidate does

Prompt budget behavior that now matters:
1. Cached `analyze-project` summaries can be injected ahead of auto-scouted code snippets when they are more relevant.
2. If the cached project analysis and architecture fact pack are sufficient to answer a question, Kernforge can reply without spending extra tool iterations.
3. Deep project-structure answers are evaluated against deterministic facts, source anchors, closed directory sets, and flow invariants; contradictions trigger tool use instead of a confident cached answer.
4. Skill and MCP catalogs are now included in full only when the request is actually asking about them.
5. Auto-scout contributes fewer candidates and less text, and it now focuses on locate/definition/reference-style requests.

## 3. Recommended Real-World Flows

### 3.1 Driver Hardening Or Signing-Sensitive Work

Situation:
- You changed `driver/guard.cpp` or `driver/guard.inf`.
- Signing, symbols, verifier, or packaging readiness matters.
- Similar failures happened recently.

Recommended flow:
1. `/investigate start driver-visibility guard.sys`
2. `/investigate snapshot`
3. `/investigate note current driver visibility snapshot captured before edit`
4. `/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys`
5. `/open driver/guard.cpp`
6. Select the relevant protection logic in the viewer.
7. `/review-selection integrity risk paths and verifier interactions`
8. `/edit-selection harden registration and signing assumptions`
9. `/verify`
10. `/evidence-dashboard category:driver`
11. `/mem-search category:driver signal:signing`
12. `/investigate stop hardened signing path reviewed`

What Kernforge adds here:
1. A live driver-visibility capture before editing.
2. A tamper-oriented risk review before editing.
3. Automatic risk-oriented prompt context during review and edit.
4. Driver-aware verification steps plus recent investigation and simulation follow-up review steps.
5. Evidence-aware push or PR policy later.

### 3.2 Telemetry Provider Drift Or XML And Manifest Regression

Situation:
- You changed a provider manifest and registration logic.
- Runtime visibility is uncertain.
- You also care about observer coverage and post-incident traceability.

Recommended flow:
1. `/investigate start provider-visibility MyProvider`
2. `/investigate snapshot MyProvider`
3. `/simulate stealth-surface MyProvider`
4. `/open telemetry/provider.man`
5. Select the manifest region.
6. `/review-selection provider visibility and schema drift`
7. `/open telemetry/register_provider.cpp`
8. `/edit-selection align provider registration and fallback visibility`
9. `/verify`
10. `/evidence-search category:telemetry outcome:failed`
11. `/simulate forensic-blind-spot MyProvider`
12. `/mem-search category:telemetry signal:provider`
13. `/investigate stop provider contract and visibility reviewed`

Why this works well:
1. Investigation captures real provider state.
2. Stealth simulation asks whether you can still observe the path.
3. Forensic blind spot simulation asks whether later reconstruction will still work.
4. Verification turns those concerns into explicit review steps.

### 3.3 Memory Scan Or Pattern Scan Regression Work

Situation:
- You are adjusting scanner logic for false positives, false negatives, or evasion resistance.
- Recent scanner-related failures already exist.

Recommended flow:
1. `/simulate stealth-surface scanner-core`
2. `/open scanner/patternscan.cpp`
3. `/review-selection false positives, stealth coverage, and performance ceilings`
4. `/edit-selection reduce false positives without weakening evasion coverage`
5. `/verify`
6. `/evidence-dashboard category:memory-scan`
7. `/mem-search category:memory-scan risk:>=70`

Why this works well:
1. Scanner work is usually about coverage and evasion, not just correctness.
2. Simulation brings an extra risk lens into the prompt.
3. Verification reasserts those review concerns before the loop closes.

### 3.4 Large Multi-Step Change With Plan Review

Situation:
- The change spans driver and telemetry concerns together.
- Ordering, rollback, and review discipline matter.

Recommended flow:
1. `/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys`
2. `/simulate forensic-blind-spot guard.sys`
3. `/do-plan-review harden driver registration, improve telemetry visibility, and preserve post-incident artifacts`
4. Let the reviewer critique the plan.
5. Execute the approved plan.
6. `/verify`
7. `/evidence-dashboard`

Current strength:
1. Simulation findings can shape the planning prompt.
2. They can also shape the final plan execution prompt.

### 3.5 Tracked Feature Lifecycle Across Multiple Sessions

Situation:
- The work is substantial enough that you want durable planning artifacts.
- You expect implementation, verification, and closure to happen over more than one sitting.

Recommended flow:
1. `/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys`
2. `/new-feature harden driver registration, preserve telemetry audit artifacts, and document rollback points`
3. `/new-feature status`
4. Review the generated `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` under `.kernforge/features/<id>`.
5. `/new-feature implement`
6. `/verify`
7. `/new-feature close`

Why this works well:
1. The feature state survives session boundaries.
2. Planning artifacts are explicit and easy to inspect or regenerate.
3. Execution is intentionally separated from planning, which reduces accidental long-running edits from a rough first draft.

## 4. Command-By-Command Practical Usage

### 4.1 `/investigate`

Basic usage:

```text
/investigate start driver-visibility guard.sys
/investigate snapshot
/investigate note verifier enabled on target system
/investigate stop initial driver state captured
```

Good use cases:
1. Before editing, when you want the current driver visibility or verifier state on record.
2. When you want a quick triage snapshot before deeper driver load debugging.
3. When you want to confirm a telemetry provider is really visible live.
4. When you want a reusable runtime record that later verification and review can reference.

Key interpretation:
1. Investigation does not replace verification.
2. It captures the real-world state that should inform later work.
3. In particular, `driver-visibility` is a lightweight visibility snapshot, not a full driver load analyzer.

### 4.2 `/simulate`

Basic usage:

```text
/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys
/simulate stealth-surface MyProvider
/simulate forensic-blind-spot game.exe
```

Good use cases:
1. Right after a driver change, to look for integrity or registration risk surface.
2. Right after a telemetry change, to inspect observer visibility gaps.
3. When you want to know whether post-incident artifacts will still be usable.

Key interpretation:
1. Simulation is not proof of exploitation.
2. It is a structured way to highlight heuristic risk signals that deserve review.

### 4.3 `/review-selection` And `/edit-selection`

Basic usage:

```text
/open driver/guard.cpp
/review-selection check risk surfaces and cleanup paths
/edit-selection harden the selected registration path
```

Good use cases:
1. When only one function or block matters.
2. When you want recent simulation findings tied directly to the selected area.

Current automatic behavior:
1. If recent simulation findings match the selected path, Kernforge injects `Additional simulation risk focus` into review and edit prompts.

### 4.4 `/do-plan-review`

Basic usage:

```text
/do-plan-review harden driver load validation, improve telemetry provider visibility, and preserve audit artifacts
```

Good use cases:
1. Large or high-risk changes.
2. Work where rollback points and sequencing matter.
3. Cases where risk-oriented thinking should shape the implementation plan before edits begin.

Current automatic behavior:
1. Matching recent simulation findings are injected into the planning prompt.
2. They are also injected into the execution prompt after approval.

### 4.5 `/new-feature`

Basic usage:

```text
/new-feature harden driver registration, preserve telemetry audit artifacts, and document rollback points
/new-feature status
/new-feature plan
/new-feature implement
/new-feature close
```

Good use cases:
1. New features that need durable scope and execution artifacts.
2. Work that should pause after planning so you can review or resume later.
3. Changes that benefit from an active feature id in session context.

Current automatic behavior:
1. A tracked feature workspace is created under `.kernforge/features/<id>`.
2. `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` are regenerated when you start or re-plan the feature.
3. `/new-feature implement [id]` executes the saved plan and writes `implementation.md`.
4. `status`, `plan`, `implement`, and `close` accept unique id prefixes as well as full ids.

### 4.6 `/verify`

Basic usage:

```text
/verify
/verify --full
/verify driver/guard.cpp,telemetry/provider.man
```

What the planner currently considers:
1. Changed files
2. Security categories
3. Verification policy
4. Verification history tuning
5. Hook-injected context and extra steps
6. Recent investigation and simulation state

Good use cases:
1. After editing, when you want a real verification plan instead of a generic test command.
2. When recent investigation or simulation findings should influence validation.
3. When you want security-aware review steps in addition to build or test steps.

### 4.7 `/evidence-search` And `/evidence-dashboard`

Useful queries:

```text
/evidence-search category:driver outcome:failed
/evidence-search kind:simulation_finding severity:critical
/evidence-search signal:tamper risk:>=60
/evidence-dashboard category:telemetry
```

Good use cases:
1. When you want to inspect what simulation just produced.
2. When you want only recent signing, provider, or scanner-related failures.
3. When you want to see active overrides and recent high-risk state together.

### 4.8 `/mem-search`

Useful queries:

```text
/mem-search category:driver signal:signing
/mem-search category:telemetry tag:provider
/mem-search severity:critical risk:>=80
/mem-search artifact:guard.sys
```

Good use cases:
1. When you want earlier reasoning from previous sessions.
2. When you want long-lived context for repeated artifacts or failures.

### 4.9 `/hooks` And `/override-*`

Inspect:

```text
/hooks
/override
```

Create an exception:

```text
/override-add deny-driver-pr-with-critical-signing-or-symbol-evidence 4 urgent hotfix after manual verification
```

Clear:

```text
/override-clear all
```

Good use cases:
1. When you want to understand why policy is blocking.
2. When you need a temporary exception with an audit trail.

### 4.10 `/fuzz-func`

Basic usage:

```text
/fuzz-func ValidateRequest
/fuzz-func ValidateRequest --file src/guard.cpp
/fuzz-func ValidateRequest @src/guard.cpp
/fuzz-func @Driver/HEVD/Windows/DoubleFetch.c
/fuzz-func show latest
/fuzz-func language system
/fuzz-campaign
/fuzz-campaign run
```

What the planner currently considers:
1. Function signatures and parameter types
2. Real size, null, dispatch, and cleanup guards in the function body
3. Probe, copy, alloc, publish, and cleanup sinks on the same path
4. The caller/callee chain from the representative root
5. The file-expansion path from the selected starting file into the cited source file
6. Build context, `compile_commands.json`, and snapshot or semantic-index availability

Good use cases:
1. When you want to see branch flips and sink reachability on input-facing driver or anti-cheat code quickly.
2. When you know the suspicious file but not the best root function yet.
3. When you want concrete "which value breaks which predicate and opens which copy/probe path" guidance before normal review or editing.

Recommended reading order:
1. `Conclusion` for the top predicted problem and the most useful branch delta.
2. `Risk score table` to separate high-signal findings from noisy fallbacks.
3. `Top predicted problems` for concrete sample values, predicates, counterexamples, and pass/fail branch consequences.
4. `Source-derived attack surface` for the real probe, copy, dispatch, and cleanup evidence.

Operational notes:
1. A bare function name triggers automatic symbol resolution, while `--file` or `@path` reduces ambiguity.
2. `/fuzz-func @path` is valid even if you do not know the function name yet.
3. Source-only fuzzing results can still be useful even when native auto-run is blocked.
4. Use `/fuzz-campaign` instead of memorizing campaign substeps; Kernforge will suggest the next safe action and `/fuzz-campaign run` will apply it, including deduplicated finding lifecycle updates, libFuzzer/llvm-cov/LCOV/JSON coverage report ingestion, sanitizer/verifier/crash-dump artifact capture, coverage gap feedback, and native result evidence capture when run artifacts exist.
5. `compile_commands.json` improves native follow-up quality, but it is not a prerequisite for source-only planning.

## 5. When To Use Each Dashboard

### 5.1 `/verify-dashboard`

Best when:
1. You want recent verification trends.
2. You want to see which checks fail most often.

### 5.2 `/evidence-dashboard`

Best when:
1. You want the current workspace risk picture.
2. You want recent failed or high-risk signals plus overrides in one view.

### 5.3 `/mem-dashboard`

Best when:
1. You want long-term context, trust tiers, and verification artifact patterns.
2. You want to skim what the system has learned across sessions.

### 5.4 `/investigate dashboard`

Best when:
1. You want to see how many investigation sessions exist.
2. You want preset, finding category, and finding severity distribution.

### 5.5 `/simulate dashboard`

Best when:
1. You want to see which risk profiles you have been using.
2. You want severity, signal, finding, and recommended-action breakdowns.

## 6. Suggested Baselines By Team

### 6.1 Driver Team

Recommended:
1. Enable `windows-security`.
2. Run `driver-visibility` investigation before risky changes.
3. Run `tamper-surface` simulation before review or edit.
4. Run `/verify`.
5. Inspect `/evidence-dashboard category:driver`.
6. Promote only repeated high-risk failures to `deny`.

### 6.2 Telemetry Team

Recommended:
1. Use `provider-visibility` investigation before manifest and provider changes.
2. Run `stealth-surface` after provider changes.
3. Run `forensic-blind-spot` when incident traceability matters.
4. Run `/verify`.
5. Inspect `/evidence-search category:telemetry outcome:failed`.
6. Use `/mem-search category:telemetry tag:provider` for long-lived context.

### 6.3 Anti-Cheat Or Memory-Scan Team

Recommended:
1. Use `stealth-surface` before scanner changes.
2. Use selection-first review and edit aggressively.
3. Run `/verify`.
4. Let repeated high-risk failures drive checkpoint and deny policy.

## 7. Cases Where You Should Not Over-Enforce Yet

Avoid overly strong policy in these cases:

1. Very early prototyping
2. New projects with almost no evidence history
3. General utility work not tied to the security workflow

Recommended progression:
1. Start with `warn`
2. Move recurring issues to `ask`
3. Reserve `deny` for genuine operational incident classes

## 8. Quick Scenario Recipes

### Scenario A: Driver Integrity Hardening

```text
/investigate start driver-visibility guard.sys
/investigate snapshot
/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys
/open driver/guard.cpp
/review-selection integrity risk paths
/edit-selection harden the selected integrity checks
/verify
/evidence-dashboard category:driver
```

### Scenario B: Telemetry Provider Visibility Drift

```text
/investigate start provider-visibility MyProvider
/investigate snapshot MyProvider
/simulate stealth-surface MyProvider
/open telemetry/provider.man
/review-selection schema and visibility drift
/verify
/evidence-search category:telemetry outcome:failed
```

### Scenario C: Plan Review Before A Large Change

```text
/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys
/simulate forensic-blind-spot guard.sys
/do-plan-review harden driver registration and preserve telemetry audit artifacts
/verify
/simulate-dashboard
```

### Scenario D: Source-level fuzzing for input-facing path triage

```text
/fuzz-func @Driver/HEVD/Windows/DoubleFetch.c
/fuzz-func TriggerDoubleFetch --file Driver/HEVD/Windows/DoubleFetch.c
/fuzz-func show latest
/fuzz-campaign
/fuzz-campaign run
/verify
```

Interpretation:
1. The first run starts coarse at file scope so Kernforge can pick the representative root and the highest-risk reachable path.
2. The second run pins the target function so predicates, counterexamples, and branch deltas become more precise.
3. `show latest` lets you re-read the report and source excerpts before moving into verification or code changes.

### Scenario E: Tracked Feature With Explicit Execution

```text
/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys
/new-feature harden driver registration and preserve telemetry audit artifacts
/new-feature status
/new-feature implement
/verify
/new-feature close
```

## 9. Summary

The best current one-line description of Kernforge is this:

"Observe first, apply a risk lens, work in focused code regions, verify with recent context, and feed the result back into evidence, memory, and policy."

That means the strongest current loop is:

1. `/investigate`
2. `/simulate`
3. `/fuzz-func`
4. `/review-selection` or `/edit-selection`
5. `/do-plan-review`
6. `/new-feature`
7. `/verify`
8. `/evidence-dashboard`
9. `/mem-search`
10. Push or PR under hook policy

That loop is the clearest current Kernforge differentiator.
