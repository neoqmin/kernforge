`Kernforge` is a terminal-first AI coding CLI written in Go. It is built around a practical local workflow with strong Windows support, and is especially tuned for Windows security, anti-cheat, telemetry, and driver-oriented workflows.

Its strongest current value is not just code generation, but a `protection loop for sensitive engineering changes`.  
In particular, Kernforge is now shaped around `adaptive verification -> evidence store -> persistent memory -> hook policy -> checkpoint/rollback`, which makes it especially useful for driver, telemetry, memory-scan, and Unreal security workflows.

The most practical end-to-end workflow is described in the [English Detailed Usage Guide](./FEATURE_USAGE_GUIDE.md). The highest-value current loop is `investigate -> simulate -> review/edit/plan -> verify -> evidence/memory/hooks`.

## Why Kernforge

Kernforge is especially strong when you need to make risky engineering changes with better operational safety.

It is a good fit for:

1. Driver, signing, symbol, and package readiness work
2. Telemetry, provider, and manifest compatibility work
3. Memory-scan and Unreal integrity work that needs both security review and practical guardrails

Its current differentiators are:

1. It builds deeper verification plans from the type of change.
2. It stores verification output as structured evidence and long-lived memory.
3. It feeds that history back into push and PR policy.
4. It can create safety checkpoints before blocking high-risk flows.

## What It Currently Supports

- Interactive REPL and one-shot `-prompt` mode
- Providers: `ollama`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `openai-compatible`
- File, patch, shell, and git-oriented tool use
- Git staging, commit, push, and GitHub pull request creation through dedicated tools
- Local file mentions, image mentions, and MCP resource mentions
- Session persistence, resume, rename, clear, compact, and Markdown export
- Project memory files plus cross-session persistent memory with trust/importance metadata
- Evidence store, evidence search, and evidence dashboards
- Local `SKILL.md` skills with discovery and per-request activation
- Stdio MCP servers with tools, resources, and prompts
- Windows viewer and diff-preview windows for selection-first workflows
- Adaptive verification, verification history dashboards, checkpoints, and rollback
- Hook engine, workspace hook rules, and evidence-aware push/PR policy
- Plan-review workflow with a separate reviewer model

## Highlights

### Input And Prompting

- Interactive chat REPL
- One-shot prompt mode with `-prompt`
- Image attachments with `-image`, `-i`, or `@path/to/image.png`
- File mentions like `@main.go`
- Line-range mentions like `@main.go:120-150`
- MCP mentions like `@mcp:docs:getting-started`
- Multiline input by ending a line with `\`
- Automatic code scouting when no explicit file mention is provided

### Editing Workflow

- Diff preview before file writes
- Selection-aware edit previews
- Automatic verification after edits when applicable
- Automatic checkpoint creation before the first edit in a request
- Manual checkpoints, checkpoint diff, and rollback
- Selection-first edit and review flow through `/open`

### Security Verification And Policy Loop

- Security-aware verification for driver, telemetry, Unreal, and memory-scan changes
- Verification history and verification dashboards
- Structured evidence capture from verification
- Evidence search and evidence dashboards
- Hook-based push and PR warnings, confirmations, and blocks based on recent failed evidence
- Automatic safety checkpoint creation for repeated high-risk failure patterns

### Interactive Ergonomics

- `Tab` completion for commands, paths, mentions, MCP targets, and `/open`
- `Esc` to cancel current input
- `Esc` to cancel an in-flight request
- Windows console input history with `Up` and `Down`

### Persistence And Context

- Saved sessions with `/resume`
- Session rename and transcript export
- Persistent memory with citation ids, trust, importance, and search
- Memory search over verification categories, tags, artifacts, and failures
- Project guidance files loaded from `KERNFORGE.md` and `.kernforge/KERNFORGE.md`
- Auto locale injection based on system locale

### Extensibility

- Local skills from `SKILL.md`
- MCP tools
- MCP resources
- MCP prompts

## Quick Start

### Build

```powershell
go build -o kernforge.exe .
```

### Run

```powershell
.\kernforge.exe
```

If no provider/model is configured yet, Kernforge can:

1. Try to detect a local Ollama server.
2. Offer to use it if found.
3. Otherwise walk through provider setup.
4. Save the chosen provider, model, API key, and base URL for future runs.

### One-Shot Prompt Mode

```powershell
.\kernforge.exe -prompt "Explain the structure of this project"
```

With one image:

```powershell
.\kernforge.exe -prompt "Explain the error in this screenshot" -image .\screenshot.png
```

With multiple images:

```powershell
.\kernforge.exe -prompt "Compare these screenshots" -image .\before.png,.\after.png
```

### Run With A Specific Provider

Anthropic:

```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your_key"
.\kernforge.exe -provider anthropic -model claude-sonnet-4
```

OpenAI:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_key"
.\kernforge.exe -provider openai -model gpt-4.1
```

OpenRouter:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_key"
.\kernforge.exe -provider openrouter -model openrouter/auto
```

Ollama:

```powershell
.\kernforge.exe -provider ollama -base-url http://localhost:11434 -model qwen3.5:14b
```

OpenAI-compatible:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_key"
.\kernforge.exe -provider openai-compatible -base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 -model my-model
```

### Windows Security Workflow Example

Basic safe flow for driver changes:

1. Edit driver-related files.
2. Run `/verify` to build a verification plan biased toward signing, symbols, packaging, and verifier readiness.
3. Run `/evidence-dashboard` or `/evidence-search category:driver` to inspect recent failed evidence.
4. If needed, run `/mem-search category:driver` to pull in older session context.
5. During push or PR creation, hook policy can re-check recent evidence and respond with warnings, confirmations, blocks, or automatic checkpoints.

Recommended flow with live state and adversarial context:

1. `/investigate start driver-load guard.sys`
2. `/investigate snapshot`
3. `/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys`
4. `/open driver/guard.cpp`
5. `/review-selection integrity bypass paths`
6. `/edit-selection harden the selected integrity checks`
7. `/verify`
8. `/evidence-dashboard category:driver`

The full explanation of this loop is in the [English Detailed Usage Guide](./FEATURE_USAGE_GUIDE.md).

Basic flow for telemetry regressions:

1. Edit provider, manifest, or XML-related files.
2. Run `/verify`.
3. Run `/evidence-search category:telemetry outcome:failed` to inspect recent provider or XML failures.
4. Run `/mem-search category:telemetry tag:provider` to recall earlier reasoning and regression context.
5. Before push or PR, hooks may inject extra review context or require confirmation.

### Frequently Used Command Cheat Sheet

| `-provider <name>` | Select the provider |
| `-model <name>` | Select the model |
| `-base-url <url>` | Override the provider base URL |

## Workspace And Configuration

### Workspace Root vs Current Directory

Kernforge tracks:

- The workspace root
- The current working directory inside the REPL

The workspace root is set from `-cwd` or the process working directory at startup. File tools stay within that root.

Inside the REPL, `!cd` changes the current working directory, but it does not expand the workspace boundary.

### Config Locations

- Global config: `~/.kernforge/config.json`
- Workspace config: `.kernforge/config.json`

### Merge Order

Later sources override earlier ones:

1. Global config
2. Workspace config
3. Environment variables
