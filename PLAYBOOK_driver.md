# Kernforge Driver Playbook

This playbook explains how to use Kernforge effectively for driver, signing, symbols, packaging, and verifier-readiness work.

## 1. When To Use This Playbook

1. `.sys`, `.inf`, or `.cat` artifacts are involved.
2. Signing, symbols, packaging, or verifier readiness matters.
3. Integrity, registration, or load-path hardening matters.
4. Recent driver-related failed evidence already exists.

## 2. Recommended Baseline Flow

```text
/investigate start driver-load guard.sys
/investigate snapshot
/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys
/open driver/guard.cpp
/review-selection integrity bypass paths and verifier interactions
/edit-selection harden registration and signing assumptions
/verify
/evidence-dashboard category:driver
/mem-search category:driver signal:signing
```

## 3. What Each Stage Does

1. `/investigate start driver-load guard.sys`
Captures the current driver load state, verifier state, and filter stack.

2. `/simulate tamper-surface guard.sys`
Surfaces likely integrity, signing, and bypass pressure points.

3. `/review-selection ...`
If simulation findings match the selected range, adversarial context is injected automatically.

4. `/verify`
Adds driver-focused verification steps and recent investigation or simulation follow-up review steps.

5. `/evidence-dashboard category:driver`
Shows recent failed signing, symbol, package, or verifier-related evidence.

## 4. Signals Worth Watching Closely

1. `signal:signing`
2. `signal:symbols`
3. `severity:critical`
4. `risk:>=80`

Useful examples:

```text
/evidence-search category:driver signal:signing
/mem-search category:driver signal:symbols
/evidence-search severity:critical risk:>=80
```

## 5. Recommended Pre-PR Check

1. `/verify`
2. `/evidence-dashboard category:driver`
3. `/override`
4. Let hook policy evaluate the final push or PR path

## 6. Good Team Habits

1. Capture a live snapshot before risky driver changes.
2. Run `tamper-surface` before large hardening work.
3. Check both evidence and memory for signing and symbol issues.
4. Treat repeated failures as a workflow problem first, not just an override problem.
